# Analysing Credit Risk on European Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Overview  
This project involves analyzing the credit risk associated with a European Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platform. The dataset includes demographic and financial information of borrowers, along with details of loan transactions.  

In P2P lending, loans are typically uncollateralized, posing a significant risk to lenders. Lenders aim for higher returns as compensation for the financial risk, often facing challenges due to information asymmetry that works in favor of borrowers.  

### Objectives  
The primary goals of this project are:  
- **Understand borrower profiles**: Analyze demographic and financial attributes to identify patterns in borrower behavior.  
- **Assess credit risk**: Evaluate loan performance metrics to determine factors contributing to higher risk.  
- **Provide actionable insights**: Recommend strategies for mitigating credit risk and improving decision-making under information asymmetry.  

### üìùDataset  
The dataset includes the following key features:  
1. **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, employment status, etc.  
2. **Financial Details**: Income, credit score, loan purpose, and loan amount.  
3. **Loan Transaction Data**: Loan term, repayment history, default status, etc.  

### üîóMethodology  
The analysis follows these steps:  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover patterns and relationships between borrower attributes and loan performance.  
3. **Risk Modeling**: Use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to predict loan default risks.  
4. **Visualization**: Present findings through intuitive visualizations for effective communication.  

### ‚öôÔ∏èTools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and running the analysis.  

### üìùInsights & Results  
- Key borrower attributes influencing credit risk.  
- Identified high-risk loan categories and borrower profiles.  
- Recommendations to minimize credit default risks on the platform.  

### Conclusion  
This project provides valuable insights into credit risk factors, helping P2P lending platforms optimize their decision-making processes and improve lender confidence in an uncollateralized loan environment.
